Welcome
Welcome to Learning Nominal Language with Binders Implementation.

How to run
run with eclipe
This implementation is created as an eclipse project. After you download "algorithm1.1" folder, you could import it into eclipse and run directly. For now, you have an example to show the learning progress: 
run the learningbase.Example.class, 
follow the instructions on the console to input the language you want to learn, 
When the messege "Finished." comes, it terminates.
You can see the pdf file "example.pdf" in the root folder of the project. This show a graph about the result of learning.
